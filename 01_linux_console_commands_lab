First step - https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ - for starting the exercise
Second step - registration and start Play with Docker

2. Getting to Know the Console.
Task - 1:
Let's start writing the command in the docker playground.
On the prompt, we can input the user and password that we created during the installation. Of course, we can use the
root user, but it is not considered a good practice.
Now, letâ€™s check where (in which folder) we are with the pwd command:

========================
Command:
pwd - shows the directory path

Task - 2:
There is nothing or at least it appears to be this way. Of course, what we will see here on a clean new installation
depends on what distribution we chose and what settings there are by default.
Even though we are not familiar with all options on the ls command yet, let's check if there are any hidden files and
folders with:

========================
Command:
ls -al - shows all hidden files and folders

Task - 3:
We can also give arguments, not only options. For example, we can check what we have in the main (root) folder.
The "/" symbol is used to state that we want to access the root of our file system:

========================
Command:
ls -al / - shows everything in our main (root) folder

Task - 4:
Let's change the folder. For example, go to the "/etc" folder. This is the place where most of the configuration files
are stored. Then we can check if indeed we changed the folder:

========================
Command:
cd /etc - change the folder and open a new one. As it change the path where the SHELL operates.

Task - 5:
Now, we can check what date is today and what is the time now:

========================
Command:
date - shows the date

Task - 6:
There is a way to modify the output of the date command:

========================
Command:
date +%Y-%m-%d

Task - 7:
Should we need a calendar on the command line, we can have it easily with:

========================
Command:
cal -3 - shows the calendar for the last 3 months

Task - 8:
At any point we can ask for the history of executed commands:

========================
Command:
history - all commands that we used in the last session
