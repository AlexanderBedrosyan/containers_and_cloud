1. NGINX Server Container

In this task, we will run a simple NGINX server in a Docker container. The server only returns some server information:

Task - 1:

To create a NGINX server container, we shall first pull the NGINX server image from Docker Hub. You can find the image
documentation on Docker Hub here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxdemos/hello. You can always refer to the documentation
to get instructions on how to pull, build and run the image:

Open a CLI, for example, PowerShell or Windows Terminal or Command Prompt (PowerShell is recommended), and let's first
pull the Docker image of the server. You should just use the pull command from the documentation:

========================
Command:

docker pull nginxdemos/hello - create a new image in the docker as used the noted nginxdemos/hello
docker images - shows all images which the docker includes

Task - 2:

Now we want to run a container with the NGINX server image, which is already downloaded from Docker Hub to our local
machine. Use the docker run command and try this way:

========================
Command:

1) docker run nginxdemos/hello - this one runs a container but without name and other details which are needed. Also
this one shows the logs in real time and we need to open a second CMD to use new processes.

2) docker run -p 5000:80 nginxdemos/hello - runs container but this time includes the port which can be used for the
image.

3) docker run -p 5000:80 -d nginxdemos/hello - runs container but -d give us a chance to not continue use the same CMD

4) docker run -p 5000:80 -d --name sakeeE nginxdemos/hello - now we have name includes (sakeeE)

Task - 3:

Examine and Delete Container and Image
We can see all containers we have like this:

========================
Command:

docker ps -a - shows all containers
docker ps - shows only running containers

In our case, we have a single running container and we have the same output from the two commands.
Now let's use the terminal to stop and delete our container. Use the following commands with the container id or
container name:

========================
Command:

docker stop sakeeE - this command stop our running container
docker rm sakeeE - delete the container

Both commands return the id or the name of the container.
Finally, we can also delete the NGINX server image:

========================
Command:

docker rmi nginxdemos/hello - remove image (rmi)
